## Theming 

Theming support for light and dark mode in _./lib/theme/theme.dart_.

## Google Fonts

The theme works with google fonts. 
This is good for development purposes, but when you choose which font you want to stick with, do as they recommend, which is to download the font and put it on the **assets** folder, this way, the package won't download anything, rather take it from you assets folder.

## Assets

The assets folder keeps track of images and fonts.

## Utils

In the utils folder helpful methods are listed.
